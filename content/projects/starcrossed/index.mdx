<h2>Game Summary</h2>

StarCrossed is a local co-op game heavily inspired by classic “Magical Girl” media. Our mission is to provide an experience that focuses on the importance of collaboration and teamwork, showcased by the two-player cooperative gameplay.
This cooperative take on the classic shoot ’em up genre is played by utilizing the positioning of the characters to take out enemies with a projectile that bounces back and forth between the players. Timing and teamwork are key.
