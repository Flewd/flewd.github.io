<h2>Game Summary</h2>

A collection of minigames designed to provide students with the opportunity to practice and build proficiency in early literacy skills. Built with React and React Native to be cross platform for browsers on desktop, chromebook, iPad and built natively for Android and iOS.
All of the minigames are wrapped in a larger progression game filled with quests to guide the players through an interactive reading curriculum step by step.

<h2>My Part</h2>

<div style="text-align: left">

Worked on a large team of developers and designers to build a game featuring dozens of minigames from start to finish in React / React Native. 
- Implemented two Unity games with a method of mounting a Unity Web build in a React Component.
- Created a method for the Unity games to pass information back and forth to the larger progression game.
- Worked in a single code base that could be compiled to React and React Native using React Native Web.
- Optimized assets and code base so web games ran smoothly on slow internet connections.
