Summary of Game:
A collection of minigames designed to provide students with the opportunity to practice and build proficiency in early literacy skills. Built with React and React Native to be cross platform for browsers on desktop, chromebook, iPad and built natively for Android and iOS.
All of the minigames are wrapped in a larger progression game filled with quests to guide the players through an interactive reading curriculum step by step.

My Part:
Worked on a large team of developers and designers to build a game from start to finish in React / React Native. Brought two Unity games to completion and implemented a method of mounting a Unity WebGL build in a React Component.
Created a method for the Unity games to pass information back to the larger progression game and vice versa. Converted and set up a framework to share React and React Native code bases using React Native Web.
